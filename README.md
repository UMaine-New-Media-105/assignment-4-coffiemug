gave each flower its own color to etter distinguish what's happening in the sketch and lead in to the next part of the assignment, as I furtherd the experimentation in the sketch with regards to color. 

A4Q3

add random values to your sketch to generate a new random pattern whenever the sketch is played. added random values or ranges directly for flower placement, and added randomness to the colors which pull those options from an array of strings.
